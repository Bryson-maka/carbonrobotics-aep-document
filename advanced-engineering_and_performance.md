## 1. Foundational Questions

### 1.1 Performance Definitions

#### **Customer Success Definition**
- **Q1:** What constitutes "successful weeding" from the customer's perspective?
  - Weed detection vs. elimination percentage? (e.g., >99% weeding performance accuracy)
  - Crop damage tolerance? (e.g., <1% crops shot)
  - Field coverage efficiency? (e.g., acres/hour target based on entry timing, weed pressure, and banding configuration)

#### **Performance Measurement Ownership**
- **Q2:** Who owns the definition of "good performance" - Carbon or the customer?
  - How should Carbon establish standard benchmarks?
  - How do customer's define their success? (highly variable)
  - How do we handle conflicting expectations pre and post sale?

#### **Success Validation Methods**
- **Q3:** How should success be measured and validated?
  - Real-time machine metrics + post-Laserweeded field outcomes?
  - Customer self-reporting vs. Carbon verification?
  - Third-party validation requirements?

## 2. Customer Experience & Configuration Management

### 2.1 Configuration Complexity Challenges

**Current State Assessment:**
Based on system complexity, the LaserWeeder has numerous configs:
- DeepWeed model thresholds and WPT vs. CPT confidence levels
- P2P health and performance accuracy
- Scanner health and settle times
- Laser firing profiles based on settings and supporting field conditions

#### **Critical Questions:**

**Q4: Configuration Simplification**
- How hard should it be for customers (farm manager role) to achieve optimal settings?
- What parts of the system be "plug-and-play" with minimal configuration?
- What level of technical expertise should we assume from customers?

**Q5: Configuration Feedback Mechanisms**
- How does a customer know their settings are fucked?
- Should the system provide real-time performance scoring?
- What early warning indicators should trigger configuration review by Carbon?

### 2.2 Entry Timing & Job Planning (Phase 3 optimization)

**Current Technical Capability:**
The system provides comprehensive real-time monitoring through Prometheus/Grafana with:
- Deeepweed metrics
- Aimbot metrics
- Overall machine states

#### **Phase 3 Strategic Questions:**

**Q7: Planning Tool Development**
- How do we expose entry timing evaluations to customers for field planning and coverage visualization?
- Should we provide simulated job performance predictions?

**Q8: Performance Prediction Accuracy**
- How accurate should our job simulation capabilities be?
- What confidence levels are acceptable for planning purposes?
- How do we validate prediction accuracy against actual field results?

## 3. Performance Monitoring & Intervention

### 3.1 Real-time Performance Assessment

**Current Monitoring Capabilities:**
- **Laser/Scanner Performance:** Utilization %, overhead times, error rates
- **Computer Vision:** Deepweed detection accuracy, model overall confidence for plants in a specific field, p2p accuracy (variable conditions, e.g., windy, thinning kiss of death, .etc)
- **Mechanical Systems:** Scanner accuracy, positioning errors, speculative enabled, camera health

#### **Performance Gap Analysis Questions:**

**Q9: Performance Deviation Detection**
- How close to customer's desired outcome did the machine actually perform?
- What constitutes an "acceptable" deviation from target performance?
- Should performance thresholds be customer-specific or industry-standard?

**Q10: Performance Monitoring Granularity**
- How does Carbon monitor variations in performance across the fleet?
- Should monitoring be real-time, daily, weekly, or event-driven?
- What performance metrics require immediate vs. trend-based analysis?

### 3.2 Proactive Intervention Strategy

**Current Alerting Infrastructure:**
- Remote monitoring with semi trustable or accurate alarms
- Custom Grafana dashboards for performance based visualization

#### **Escalation Framework Questions:**

**Q11: Intervention Triggers**
- What escalation measures should Carbon use to address issues before customer intervention?
- Should interventions be automatic, recommended, or manual?
- How do we balance customer autonomy with proactive support?

**Q12: Support Response Model**
- When should Carbon initiate contact vs. waiting for customer issues?
- What performance degradation patterns warrant immediate action?
- How do we measure intervention effectiveness?

## 4. Responsibility Matrix & Ownership Framework

### 4.1 Shared vs. Sole Ownership Definition

#### **Areas Requiring Leadership Decision:**

**Q13: Customer Sole Ownership**
*What should customers be fully responsible for?*
- Field preparation and planning?
- Basic maintenance and cleaning?
- Initial configuration parameter selection?
- Performance expectation setting?

**Q14: Carbon Sole Ownership**  
*What should Carbon be fully responsible for?*
- Software updates and bug fixes?
- Hardware reliability and warranty?
- Algorithm accuracy and model performance?
- Technical support and troubleshooting for out of performance range expectations?

**Q15: Shared Ownership Framework**
*What requires collaborative ownership?*
- Performance optimization and tuning?
- Field condition adaptation?
- Success metric definition and measurement?
- Training and knowledge transfer?

### 4.2 Accountability Boundaries

**Q16: Performance Accountability**
- When performance falls short, how do we determine root cause ownership?
- Should there be formal SLAs between Carbon and customers?
- How do we handle disputes over performance responsibility?

**Q17: Continuous Improvement Responsibility**
- Who drives ongoing performance optimization - Carbon or customer?
- Should improvements be push-based (Carbon-driven) or pull-based (customer-requested)?
- How do we prioritize improvement investments across the customer base?
