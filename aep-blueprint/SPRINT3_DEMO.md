## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Test Admin Access
1. Navigate to `/admin/sections`
2. Verify you can see the sections management page
3. Test creating a new section
4. Test editing an existing section
5. Test drag & drop section ordering

### 3. Test Question Management
1. Click on a section to enter question management
2. Test creating new questions
3. Test editing existing questions
4. Test drag & drop question ordering
5. Test the history diff modal by clicking the info icon

### 4. Test History Diff
1. In question management, click the info icon on any question
2. Verify the history modal opens
3. Test selecting different versions
4. Verify the Monaco diff editor shows differences
5. Test with questions that have multiple answer versions

### 5. Test Export Functionality
1. In the admin sections page, click "Export MD"
2. Verify a markdown file downloads
3. Click "Export PDF" (placeholder implementation)
4. Verify the file contains all sections and final answers

## üìã Database Setup Required

### 1. Apply Migration
```sql
-- Apply supabase/migrations/0005_sprint3_admin.sql
-- This adds admin RLS policies and batch update functions
```

### 2. Configure Supabase Storage
```sql
-- Create storage bucket for images (if not already exists)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('images', 'images', true);

-- Set up storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Function
```bash
# Deploy the export function
supabase functions deploy export_prd
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
- Added admin RLS policies for all tables
- Created batch update functions for drag & drop
- Enhanced progress views with SQL-based calculations

### Component Architecture
- **Admin Components**: Modular admin-specific components
- **DnD Integration**: Proper drag & drop with collision detection
- **Monaco Integration**: Dynamic import to avoid SSR issues
- **Export Integration**: Edge function with role-based access

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch database updates for drag & drop
- Optimistic UI updates
- Query invalidation strategies
- Dynamic imports for heavy components

## üé® User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- Success/error notifications
- Drag & drop visual indicators
- Disabled states during operations

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- Proper ARIA labels
- High contrast colors

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Changes**
   - Apply Sprint 3 migrations
   - Configure Supabase Storage
   - Deploy Edge Functions

2. **User Testing**
   - Test all admin workflows
   - Verify export functionality
   - Test drag & drop across different screen sizes

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large datasets
